# Overview

With this program I demonstrate the level of knowledge that I have been aquire of the Java language.
I used Visual Studio Code as a centralized enviroment for the development of programs.

What this basic program do is to give the user a random family activity to do. It has diferent options depending of the day of the week. For example, if today is Thurday then maybe the program will recommend to wath a movie, but if today is Sunday then the program could recommend to visit grandparents.

It's just a fun way to pick an option to do as a family.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.  Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}
